  fullDescription: 'The ''Tutorial Handler'' object is a template that contains several
    tutorials used to teach players certain parts of the game. The desired features
    can be adjusted from the ''Lesson Model'' component in the course. The ''GetLesson''
    generic method of the ''TutorialHandler'' is used to call the lessons.

    The
    default lessons include the ''Click Button Lesson'', which creates a tutorial
    showing a button to be pressed, and the ''Click Object Lesson'', which creates
    a tutorial targeting an object that needs to be clicked. Users can also create
    new lessons by inheriting from the ''LessonModel'' class and placing them under
    the Resources>LessonPrefabs folder as prefabs.
