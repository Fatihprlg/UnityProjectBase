    This
    class keeps track of the current location of the ''pointer'', the subject it
    was pressed on, and the ''delta'' information. In order for it to work, the ''PointerUpdate()''
    function must be called in the ''Update'' function in a ''MonoBehaviour'' class
    under the desired condition.
