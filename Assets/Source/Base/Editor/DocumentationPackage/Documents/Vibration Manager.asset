  fullDescription: "The Vibration Manager is a static class that can be accessed
    from anywhere in your game. \nHere's how you can use it:\n\tCall the static methods
    in the Vibration Manager and use the \"Vibration Types\" enum to give the desired
    vibration.\n\tTo ensure that the vibration does not start if the given second
    has not passed since the previous vibration, give a threshold value to the method.\n\tUse
    the Vibration Manager to turn vibration on or off.\n"
