  shortDescription: The 'DataHandler' class is responsible for permanently storing
    user data. It stores objects derived from the 'Data Model' class as binary files.
    To access any data from the code, the 'Data' property, which is 'static', is
    used. For example, 'PlayerDataModel.Data.requested Information' can be used to
    access 'Player' data. To save changes made to data, the 'DataHandler' automatically
    saves data using the 'Application Focus' event function within itself.

    Clear All Data, use ClearAllData button in EditorWindow.\nTo create a new 'data
    model', the user must enter the name of the new data model in the box above the
    'Create New Data Model' button and click the button. The new 'data model' must
    then be initialized like other models in the 'Data Handler' class and added to
    the 'Save' function.\nThe 'GetMoney' button in the editor window can be used
    to add money while testing. The amount of money to be added must be entered in
    the box above the button and the button must be pressed.\n"
