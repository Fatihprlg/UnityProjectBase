  shortDescription: 'The ''Screen Controller'' class manages a ''boolean'' value
    named ''autoChangeScreen'' to trigger the list of screens, the active screen,
    and automatic switching of screens. If this ''boolean'' value is selected from
    the editor, a method involving screen changes is added to the ''onStateChange''
    events of the ''game controller'' element. This way, the appropriate screen is
    automatically loaded at each state change.

  fullDescription: "The 'Screen Controller' class manages a 'boolean' value named
    'autoChangeScreen' to trigger the list of screens, the active screen, and automatic
    switching of screens. If this 'boolean' value is selected from the editor, a
    method involving screen changes is added to the 'onStateChange' events of the
    'game controller' element. This way, the appropriate screen is automatically
    loaded at each state change.\nThe 'MainScreenIndex' value in the editor shows
    the first screen that will open when the game starts. The screens are rotated
    sequentially from this index. The screens before the main index are the screens
    that will be shown in certain situations and are constantly active, such as the
    Tutorial or PopUp screens.\nThe screens available by default are:\n\tMain Screen:
    It is the main menu of the game. In the 'upgrade screen', player money, department
    information, and other information are available. Player money and episode information
    are automatically retrieved from the 'Player Data Model' object.\n\tGame Screen:
    It is the screen that appears while playing the game. Player money and chapter
    information are also displayed here and adjusted automatically.\n\tEnd Screen:
    It is the section end screen. If the player successfully completed the level,
    it will show the 'Win Screen', otherwise it will trigger the 'Lose Screen' element.\n\tTutorial
    Screen: It is the screen element that contains the tutorials added to the game.
    It stays blank if no training is added."
