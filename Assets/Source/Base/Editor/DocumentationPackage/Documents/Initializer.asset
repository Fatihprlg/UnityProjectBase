  shortDescription: The 'Initializer' class allows us to manage the 'default execution
    order' definition in Unity using a different perspective. When Unity is started,
    its self-defined 'Event Functions' are executed in an order that may differ from
    device to device if not defined manually. This can cause reference drops if the
    order of the working class changes first in the dependencies established between
    classes.
  fullDescription: 'The ''Initializer'' class allows us to manage the ''default execution
    order'' definition in Unity using a different perspective. When Unity is started,
    its self-defined ''Event Functions'' are executed in an order that may differ
    from device to device if not defined manually. This can cause reference drops
    if the order of the working class changes first in the dependencies established
    between classes.

    The ''Initializer'' class solves this problem by using
    the ''Initialize'' method of the ''IInitializable'' interface. The user sorts
    the classes derived from the ''IInitializable'' class in the scene and for which
    the ''Initialize'' operation is requested, into the component as desired, and
    the ''Initializer'' class initializes these classes at once when the scene is
    loaded. The ''InitializeOnAwake'' option should be left on to ''initialize''
    the items added to the list, respectively, within the ''Awake'' function. It
    is recommended that this option not be turned off except in special circumstances.
