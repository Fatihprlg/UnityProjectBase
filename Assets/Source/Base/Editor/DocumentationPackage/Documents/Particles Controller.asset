  shortDescription: 'To create a particle pool system, you need a "Particles Controller"
    object that manages and holds the particle pools in the scene.

'
  fullDescription: "Create an empty object and make it a child of the \"Particles
    Controller\" object.\n\t-Add the \"Particle Pool Model\" component to this object.\n\t-Add
    the \"Particle Base Model\" component to each object that will be added to the
    pool so that the pool can see the objects.\n\t-Add the \"particle\" objects as
    children to the pool object.\n\t-Click the \"GetDeactiveItems\" button in the
    \"Particle Pool Model\" component to add the particle objects to the pool list.\n\t-Drag
    and drop the pool object to the \"Particle Pools\" list in the \"Particles Controller\"
    object.\n\t-To call the pool object in the code, call the \"SetParticle\" method
    from the \"static\" \"instance\" element of the \"particle controller\" element.
    This method has two applications:\n\t    -In the first application, the pool
    index of the particle object to be called, the world position, and the type of
    vibration to be given together with the particle should be given as parameters.\n\t   
    -In the second application, in addition to these properties, it is possible to
    give a rotation to the particle in terms of \"Quaternion\".\n\n\n{0}\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n"
