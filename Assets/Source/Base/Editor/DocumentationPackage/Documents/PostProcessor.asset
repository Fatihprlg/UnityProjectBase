  shortDescription: 'Post processing is a commonly used technique in Unity to apply
    visual effects and make adjustments to the image by giving some effects to the
    camera. The ''PostProcessor'' module includes two pre-made image profiles designed
    for this purpose, which can be easily changed via the editor. It provides a standard
    and simple image profile, called ''Classic'', and a more advanced profile, called
    ''Contrast'', which includes more color settings and effects. '
  fullDescription: 'Post processing is a commonly used technique in Unity to apply
    visual effects and make adjustments to the image by giving some effects to the
    camera. The ''PostProcessor'' module includes two pre-made image profiles designed
    for this purpose, which can be easily changed via the editor. It provides a standard
    and simple image profile, called ''Classic'', and a more advanced profile, called
    ''Contrast'', which includes more color settings and effects. To select one of
    these profiles, simply press the corresponding button in the editor. The ''PostProcessor''
    module automatically inserts the selected profile into the ''volume''. Additionally,
    custom profiles can be added to the ''volume'', which will automatically appear
    as a new button in the editor.

    When adjusting the profile, different images
    can be obtained by changing the ''lookup texture'' (LUT) picture in the ''Color
    Lookup'' section. The LUT is used as the ''Color Correction LUT'', which is a
    texture used to perform color grading in a post-processing effect. Instead of
    manipulating individual color channels via curves, as with color correction curves,
    only a single texture is used to produce the corrected image. The appropriate
    image can be obtained by using the textures located under the ''Assets/Base/PostProcess/Resources/LUT''
    folder in the project.
